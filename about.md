Hi there, I’m Harry. I’m a bike-riding web developer from Leeds, UK.

Professionally, I help some of the world’s largest and most respected
organisations tackle site-speed issues—nobody likes a slow website, and it’s my
job to make them faster.

When I’m not working, you can find me riding one of my bikes—at the moment, my
main focus is on road riding.

I’m self employed and work across the globe consulting, speaking, and training.
Having worked in over 40 countries, I’m possibly the luckiest boy alive.

Away from work, my main focuses are food (both cooking and eating), drink (both
making and enjoying), and bikes (both mountain and road).
