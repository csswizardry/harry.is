Hi there, I’m Harry. I turn code into bikes.

I’m a web developer, cyclist, mountain biker, and food and drink enthusiast from
Leeds, UK. Professionally, I help some of the world’s largest and most respected
organisations tackle site-speed issues—nobody likes a slow website, and it’s my
job to make them faster.

When I’m not doing that, you can find me riding one of my bikes.

       src="/img/content/me-bike.jpg"
       alt=""
       width="1280"
       height="720"
       fetchpriority="high"
       decoding="sync"
       elementtiming="about-image"
       onload="performance.clearMarks('About Page Image'); performance.mark('About Page Image');"
  />
  <script>
    performance.clearMarks("About Page Image");
    performance.mark("About Page Image");
  </script>
</figure>

I’m self employed and work across the globe consulting, speaking, and training.
Having worked in over 40 countries, I’m possibly the luckiest boy alive.

Away from work, my main focuses are food (both cooking and eating), drink (both
making and enjoying), and bikes (both mountain and road).
