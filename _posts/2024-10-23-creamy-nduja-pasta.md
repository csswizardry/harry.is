’Nduja is a flavourful, spicy, spreadable pork sausage from Italy’s Calabria
region. This simple dish—one of my current favourites—combines it with cream and
pasta for a proper ten-minute meal. For a bit of texture and colour, we’ll
finish it with a quick Parmesan and parsley gratin. But be warned: this meal
isn’t exactly a nutritional powerhouse, so enjoy it in moderation! That said,
its bold flavours and indulgent creaminess make it a perfect occasional treat.

Before we start, two words of warning:

1. **This dish does not appreciate high temperatures.** Keep things on a low
   heat—trust me. More on this as we get to it. As a result, it might be worth
   preheating some pasta dishes to serve in.
2. **There are no real quantities with this recipe.** I have always just
   freestyled this meal and adjusted to taste and audience. It’s an incredibly
   simple recipe that is relatively tolerant, but I’ll address the issue of
   [leftover ingredients at the end](#leftovers).

## You Will Need

  <figcaption>There’s very little needed, especially if you forgo the gratin.</figcaption>

Again, unofficially, this should serve two people, or one very hungry person and
some leftovers.

**Creamy ’nduja pasta:**

* Pasta
  * I recommend paccheri for big, full pasta, or orecchiette for spoonfuls of
    deliciously little shapes. Here, I’m using paccheri.
* ’Nduja paste
  * We’re cooking it, so you don’t need the really good stuff that you’d usually
    serve on bread.
* Double cream
* Fresh flat leaf parsley
* Parmigiano Reggiano
  * Known more commonly as Parmesan here in the UK.

**Gratin (optional):**

* Breadcrumbs
* Butter

## Gratin

<img src="/img/content/2024/10/nduja-03.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" class="c-image  c-image--left">

We’ll build the (optional) gratin first as it doesn’t need to be served hot—we
can leave it to one side while we focus on the main event, next.

In a small, preferably nonstick pan, slowly melt enough butter to coat the
bottom. Once melted, evenly sprinkle a layer of breadcrumbs, careful to avoid
any clumping.

Gently toss to coat and slowly toast. After a few minutes, when starting to turn
golden, add a sprinkle of Parmesan. Again, be careful to avoid clumping as it
will cause the breadcrumbs to stick, losing their crunchy texture. Keep tossing,
coating, and toasting until they look delicious. Always on a low heat.

Once they look about right, remove from the heat and mix in some finely chopped
parsley. Set aside for later.

## Creamy ’Nduja Sauce

<img src="/img/content/2024/10/nduja-05.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" class="c-image  c-image--right">

The sauce can be made to take about as long as your pasta as, remember, we need
to cook over a very low heat. Get a large pan of heavily salted water boiling,
add your pasta, and cook about two minutes short of what the pack tells you (for
me, that’s 10 minutes).

While your pasta is cooking, take a huge dollop of ’nduja and slowly render it
down over a very low heat. I can’t stress enough how much this dish needs low
temperatures. This step comes together remarkably quickly, so don’t worry if it
only takes a few minutes—we can hold the sauce until your pasta is ready.

Gently cook the ’nduja down, stirring occasionally to help break it up:

<figure>
  <img src="/img/content/2024/10/nduja-06.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>The ’nduja may take on a very dark colour, looking almost burnt! It’s not, don’t worry, but do keep that heat nice and low.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the ’nduja has fully rendered, it’s time to add our cream. Despite its high
fat content, cream is still about 60% water, and we’re about to combine it with
the fat released from the ’nduja. Since oil and water famously don’t mix,
forming a stable emulsion can be quite tricky. Three things hinder an emulsion:

1. Introducing the components **too quickly**;
2. **Not stirring** the mixture enough;
3. **Too much** heat.

To combat this, there are three things we’re going to do:

1. **Slowly pour** our cream, while
2. **constantly whisking** together, over a
3. **very low** heat.

Remove the pan from the heat entirely, and slowly pour in your first drizzle of
cream. Enthusiastically stir this into the ’nduja so that they combine. Continue
adding, stirring, adding, stirring, until the sauce reaches your desired
creaminess.

  <figcaption>Keep adding cream until it looks like something you might want to eat.</figcaption>
</figure>

The secondary benefit of adding the cream slowly is that you don’t accidentally
make a sauce that is _too_ creamy. It’s easy to add more; it’s impossible to
take away. As with any cooking, continually taste and adjust.

Once you’ve gotten the sauce to the desired consistency, still over minimal
heat, you can hold it there while your pasta finishes cooking. Taste and adjust
for seasoning.

  <figcaption>Once you’re looking at something like this, check and adjust seasoning.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once your pasta is ready, drain it but **keep a cup of the starchy pasta
water**. Gradually add cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. When you
feel like the pasta has saturated the sauce and there isn’t enough liquid to
coat what remains, add a drizzle of pasta water. This well lengthen the sauce
without thinning it out too much. In fact, it will give it a beautiful
consistency that you will hear as you toss it. Starch also helps sauces cling to
pasta, meaning a well-combined plating.

Pasta water is a magical and valuable ingredient.

Continue adding cooked pasta and pasta water until you have genuinely reached
the limit. If you have leftover cooked pasta, that’s no big deal.

Now stir in a handful of the chopped parsley and toss some more to mix.

### Oh, No! My Sauce Has Split!

If you've made a mistake, either by adding the cream too quickly or cooking it
over too much heat, your sauce can _split_. This happens when the water in the
cream separates from the fat, leaving you with a sauce that looks curdled—lumpy
in some areas, with oily pools in others.

**Don’t panic!**

There are a few tricks to rescue a split cream sauce. One option is to blend it
to re-emulsify, but that involves extra effort and washing up. Instead, remove
the pan from the heat immediately and stir in an ice cube. The rapid cooling
helps to stop further separation, and the water from the melting ice encourages
the sauce to come back together.

That’s a really good pro-tip for any cream-based sauce right there.

## Serve

Generously spoon the pasta out into your pre-warmed dishes. Ensure each piece of
pasta has a good coating of sauce, or ladle more over if necessary. Sprinkle
over a decent amount of the gratin, and enjoy!

## Leftovers

Got leftover gratin? Great! That stuff is delicious. Store at room temperature
in an airtight container and sprinkle it on soups, roasted vegetables,
a courgette salad, or other pasta dishes.

Leftover parsley? Use that in your [shakshuka](/cooking/shakshuka/) tomorrow
morning.

Got some leftover cooked pasta? Coat it in good quality olive oil and black
pepper and you have a great cold (if a little carby) snack.

Everything else can stay in your cupboard or fridge for another occasion.
