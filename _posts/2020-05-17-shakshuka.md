While this breakfast dish might appear to have a lot of ingredients, most of
them are readily available and actually make for an incredibly simple and
straightforward recipe. Plus you can safely leave out eggs and feta to make this
already-healthy brunch favourite vegan-friendly.

* Zatar or sumac

**Harissa Butter (optional):**

## Shakshuka

Preheat an oven to 180ºC. If you don’t have an oven-safe frying pan, place an
ovenproof dish into the oven for later.

Sweat your onion, red pepper, and garlic in a little olive oil until the onion
softens and turns translucent.

Meanwhile, combine your cumin, paprika, and chili flakes and toast lightly over
a very low heat. This will release the aromatics from the spices and make the
flavours more bold and fragrant. This step is entirely optional, but we have
plenty of time.

Once your onion and pepper is softened, add the spices along with a tablespoon
(15ml) of tomato purée and combine into a thick paste.

Cook out for a minute or two before adding your chopped tomatoes and a handful
of parsley (as much or as little as you like). Season generously and leave to
simmer for 5 minutes.

Once everything has come together, make two wells in the sauce and add your
eggs.

Move the pan to the oven and cook for 6 minutes. I’d recommend keeping an eye on
things after the five-minute mark to ensure you don’t end up overcooking the
eggs—you want the whites to be just-set as they’ll continue to cook up when
removed from the oven.

## Harissa Butter

This breakfast becomes a lot more fulfilling when served with some nice
sourdough. To complement the spices of the region (North Africa and the Middle
East) used in the shakshuka, a compound harissa butter makes a great addition to
your toast.

</figure>

While the shakshuka is in the oven, take as much softened butter as you’ll need
for the amount of toast you’re going to make and add 1tsp of harissa paste.
Combine using a fork and check for taste, increasing the amount of harissa paste
accordingly. You can add a small amount of garlic and a pinch of cumin if you
like, and if you’re using unsalted butter, you probably want to season it, too.

The point of the butter is to make it to your preference, so taste and adjust
until you’re happy.

Come on now…

## Serving

When the shakshuka is finished, remove from the oven and garnish with crumbled
feta, some more parsley, and a sprinkle of either zatar or sumac.
