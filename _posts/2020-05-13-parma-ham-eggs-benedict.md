Eggs Benedict has always been a breakfast favourite of mine, but I’ve only
recently begun making it at home. Some neat tricks and little hacks turn
a series of very simple ingredients into a delicious, decadent brunch—it’ll come
together quicker than you think.

Traditionally, Eggs Benedict would be served with bacon and on an English
muffin, but I find that the salty, umami, rich flavour of Parma ham and the
buttery, sweet flavour of brioche, contrasts incredibly with the tang of the
Hollandaise and the richness off the egg yolk.

**Fun fact:** The pigs bred for Parma ham are fed on the leftover whey from the
region’s other famous export, _parmigiano reggiano_. This is why you can detect
a distinct and almost cheesy funk in the meat.

## You Will Need

* 1× brioche bun
* 2× slices of Parma Ham
* 3× very fresh eggs
* 75g butter
* Lemon juice

## Hollandaise Sauce

If you’ve ever tried to make Hollandaise sauce, I’m sure you’ve run into trouble
and frustration at least once before. Bains-marie, whisks, delicate balancing
acts with heat, and it soon becomes very easy to get wrong. Way too stressful
when you’re trying to make breakfast. Sacrilegious as it may be, I use a far
simpler method that yields the same outcomes. Work smart, not hard.

</figure>

Gently melt the butter in a milk pan. Ensure that it is fully melted and hot,
but make sure it doesn’t burn. Avoid stirring or otherwise agitating the butter,
as we want to try and separate the white solids that will sink from the fat that
will float—it’s this clear fat that we need, so skim off any floating solids.

Meanwhile, add the yolk of one egg to a small food processor or blender. Season
lightly and once the butter is ready, gently pour a splash at a time into the
blender and briskly blitz. It’s vital that you don’t flood the yolk, so add the
butter gradually. The heat of the butter will cook the mixture, but ensure it’s
not boiling. Keep adding, blitzing, adding, blitzing until you’ve reached the
desired consistency. Don’t be alarmed if you have butter left over—it’s better
that way than not having enough.

back of a spoon.</figcaption>

Once you’re happy with the thickness of the sauce, add a squeeze of lemon juice.
Taste and adjust as necessary. Transfer to a preheated (but not hot) serving jug
or ramekin until needed in a few minutes.

## Parma Ham

Preheat an oven to 180ºC. Lay two slices of Parma ham on a cold baking sheet.
Place the tray in the oven just before you add your eggs to the pan in the next
step. That’s all there is to it.

texture to the meal.</figcaption>

## Poached Eggs

The thing about Eggs Benedict is that it combines two reasonably complex and
error-prone techniques. Making Hollandaise and poaching eggs are both things
that can, and very often do, go wrong. Miraculously, I’ve managed to nail
a technique for poached eggs that has close to 100% accuracy.

The most important thing is your eggs. They need to be high-quality and very
fresh. Grade A eggs have thicker whites which better support the yolk, and as
eggs age, the whites will thin. Ergo, fresh, grade A eggs will have whites much
better suited to poaching.

Fill a wide pan about 5–7cm deep with water and slowly bring to a simmer. It’s
imperative that you don’t place eggs into boiling water as two things will
happen:

1. **The eggs will overcook.** 100ºC is far too hot for eggs.
2. **The whites will tear apart.** The turbulence caused by boiling is likely to
   ruin the eggs.

When the water is beginning to simmer, bubbles appear on the bottom of the pan.
Put your Parma ham in the oven now and prepare to poach!

If your eggs are fresh enough, you won’t need to use any of the vinegar or
whirlpool hacks you may have read about. Simply lower the ramekin into the
water—actually into the water—and once the water level reaches the lip of the
bowl, smoothly but swiftly tip out the egg into the water. It should be
a smooth, seamless motion.

As they’re cooking, begin lightly toasting your brioche.

You shouldn’t need a timer as it’s quite easy to see the progress, but for
reference you’re aiming at about 3–4 minutes. Once the eggs are done, fish them
out with a slotted spoon and rest on a paper towel while you trim any wispy,
unsightly bits of egg white.

That’s it! Everything is done. Stack your brioche, Parma ham, poached eggs, and
then drizzle with Hollandaise. Serve with coarsely ground black pepper and
watercress (which nobody ever eats, but this is a dish that can really use the
greenery).
